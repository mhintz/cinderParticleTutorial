# Cinder Tutorial Project

### Learning project for both C++ and Cinder
I'm working through the Hello Cinder tutorial at [http://libcinder.org/docs/v0.8.5/hello_cinder.html](http://libcinder.org/docs/v0.8.5/hello_cinder.html).
I've made a couple small adjustments that have gotten interesting enough that it seemed like a good idea to push them up.
Free hosting isn't bad, either.
